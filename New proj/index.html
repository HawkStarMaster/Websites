            document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets
            people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the

            You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills 
            are necessary too, but the example files are commented 
            well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting 
            points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced 
            tutorials and tips on working with CSS.

            You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish,
            but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve 
            never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to 
            learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.

            Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. 
            Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t 
            submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web 
            server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of 
            that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use 
            it we will download it and place it on our server.
